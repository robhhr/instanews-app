### Instanews App

<p>The main purpose of the project was to create a news fetching website that gets data from NY Time's API Top Stories.</p>
<p>The method used for fetching NYT's API is a jQuery implementation of an Ajax request when an event listener triggers.</p>

<p>There are 3 main breakpoints:

- Mobile (< 600px)
- Tablet (> 600px)
- Desktop (> 1240px)

The article section changes layout after every breakpoint making it suitable for easy reading and navigation.</p>
